    "# Core Python Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers two ways to run code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interactive Mode**: Experiment in the Python Interpreter for instant results.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   >>> 2 + 2\n",
    "   4\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Script Mode**: Write code in a `.py` file (e.g., `script.py`) and run it from the terminal:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python script.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "# Everything in Python is an Object!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Everything is an Object in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **everything is an object**—a core idea that makes the language powerful and easy to use. Whether it’s a number, a piece of text, a list, or even a function, Python treats them all as objects. If you’re new to coding, don’t worry—this guide will explain what this means, why it matters, and how it helps you write better code, using simple analogies and examples. Let’s dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Does \"Everything is an Object\" Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine Python as a world where every piece of data is like an item in a toolbox. Each item (or **object**) has:\n",
    "- **A type**: What kind of item it is (e.g., a number, text, or list).\n",
    "- **An identity**: A unique ID, like a label that distinguishes it.\n",
    "- **Attributes and methods**: Properties (data) and actions (like functions) it can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- The number `42` is an object of type `int`.\n",
    "- The text `\"hello\"` is an object of type `str` with actions like `.upper()` to make it `\"HELLO\"`.\n",
    "- A function you write is an object that can be stored or passed around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Python are like sticky notes—they label these objects but don’t hold the data themselves. This object-centered approach makes Python consistent and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 42          # An integer object\n",
    "y = \"Python\"    # A string object\n",
    "def say_hi():   # A function object\n",
    "    return \"Hi!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(type(x))        # <class 'int'>\n",
    "print(y.upper())      # PYTHON\n",
    "print(type(say_hi))   # <class 'function'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Does Python Make Everything an Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s designers chose this approach to keep the language simple, consistent, and powerful. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Keeps Things Consistent**\n",
    "By treating everything as an object, Python ensures all data works the same way. You can:\n",
    "- Check the type with `type()`.\n",
    "- Get a unique ID with `id()`.\n",
    "- Use the dot (`.`) to access attributes or methods (if available).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means you don’t need different rules for numbers, strings, or functions—they all follow the same logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num = 10\n",
    "text = \"hello\"\n",
    "print(type(num))      # <class 'int'>\n",
    "print(type(text))     # <class 'str'>\n",
    "print(id(num))        # Unique ID\n",
    "print(text.capitalize())  # Hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Simplifies Memory Management**\n",
    "Objects live in your computer’s memory, and variables are pointers to them. This lets Python:\n",
    "- **Reuse objects**: Small numbers (like `42`) or common strings are shared to save memory.\n",
    "- **Support dynamic typing**: You can change a variable’s type (e.g., from a number to a string) because objects carry their own type info.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 42\n",
    "b = 42\n",
    "print(id(a) == id(b))  # True (same object for efficiency)\n",
    "\n",
    "a = \"code\"\n",
    "print(type(a))  # <class 'str'> (type changed easily)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Powers Object-Oriented Programming**\n",
    "Python is built for object-oriented programming (OOP), where you organize code into objects. Making everything an object lets you:\n",
    "- Create custom objects that act like built-in types.\n",
    "- Use OOP features like inheritance (building on existing objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even simple types like numbers have methods, making them feel like “mini-objects.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Built-in object with methods\n",
    "text = \"python\"\n",
    "print(text.upper())  # PYTHON\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your own object\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "    def meow(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "print(cat.meow())  # Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Enables Flexibility**\n",
    "Since everything is an object, you can inspect or modify them at runtime. For example, you can:\n",
    "- List an object’s features with `dir()`.\n",
    "- Pass functions or classes as arguments.\n",
    "- Add new properties dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dir(add))  # Shows the function’s attributes\n",
    "my_operations = [add]  # Store function as an object\n",
    "print(my_operations[0](2, 3))  # 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Does This Work Under the Hood?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a peek at Python’s internals (don’t worry if it sounds technical—you don’t need to memorize this!):\n",
    "- **Objects in Memory**: Every object is a structure in memory with a type, value, and reference count. For example, `42` is an `int` object with the value `42`.\n",
    "- **Common Base**: In CPython (the main Python version), all objects share a base structure called `PyObject`, which holds metadata like type.\n",
    "- **Reference Counting**: Python tracks how many variables point to an object. If none do, the object is removed to free memory.\n",
    "- **Type Info**: Each object knows its type, so Python can handle it correctly (e.g., adding numbers or joining strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python creates an `int` object for `42` (or reuses an existing one), and `x` points to it. The object has:\n",
    "- Type: `int`\n",
    "- ID: Viewable with `id(x)`\n",
    "- Value: `42`\n",
    "- Methods: Like `__add__` for `42 + 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Helps You Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that everything is an object makes coding easier and avoids mistakes. Here’s how:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Avoiding Traps with Mutable Objects**\n",
    "Since variables point to objects, changing a mutable object (like a list) affects all variables referencing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "other_list = my_list  # Same object\n",
    "other_list.append(4)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4] (changed too!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from copy import copy\n",
    "other_list = copy(my_list)  # New object\n",
    "other_list.append(4)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3] (unchanged)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Using Methods**\n",
    "Even basic types have handy methods to simplify your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"  alice  \"\n",
    "print(name.strip().title())  # Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Writing Flexible Code**\n",
    "You can treat functions or classes like data, opening up creative possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def multiply(a, b):\n",
    "    return a * b\n",
    "\n",
    "actions = {\"multiply\": multiply}\n",
    "print(actions[\"multiply\"](4, 5))  # 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Creating Your Own Objects**\n",
    "You can build custom classes that work like Python’s built-in types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Task:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "    def complete(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} is done!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "task = Task(\"Study\")\n",
    "print(task.complete())  # Study is done!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters for Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re new to coding, the “everything is an object” idea is exciting because:\n",
    "- **It’s Simple**: You learn one way to handle all data—no special cases.\n",
    "- **It’s Like Real Life**: Objects are like items you can label, inspect, or use, making code feel intuitive.\n",
    "- **It Builds Skills**: Understanding this prepares you for advanced topics like OOP or data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation Tip**: Feeling confused? That’s normal! Try small experiments in PyCharm’s Python Console (Tools > Python Console). Type `type(10)`, `dir(\"test\")`, or `id(42)` to explore objects. Each step makes you a stronger coder.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: Are there exceptions to “everything is an object”?\n",
    "A: Almost everything you work with (numbers, strings, functions) is an object. However, keywords (`if`, `for`) and operators (`+`, `=`) are part of Python’s syntax, not objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: Do other languages do this?\n",
    "A: Some languages (like C) use “primitive” types (e.g., `int`) that aren’t objects to be faster. Python chooses simplicity over speed, making it easier to learn but slightly slower for some tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: Does this slow Python down?\n",
    "A: Objects add a bit of overhead, but Python optimizes things like reusing small numbers. For speed, you can use tools like NumPy or write parts in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Try It Yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "Open PyCharm and play with these:\n",
    "1. **Check Types and IDs**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   a = 100\n",
    "   b = 100\n",
    "   print(type(a), id(a), id(b))  # Are they the same object?\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Explore Methods**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   word = \"coding\"\n",
    "   print(dir(word))  # See available methods\n",
    "   print(word.upper())  # Try one\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Make Your Own Object**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Pet:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "           self.name = name\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           return f\"{self.name} says hi!\"\n",

    "# Understanding Python Variables: Everything is an Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to learning about Python variables! In Python, **everything is an object**—numbers, text, lists, and even functions are objects with their own type and identity. This idea is key to understanding how Python works. Variables are like labels you stick on these objects, making it easy to store, access, and work with data in your programs. This guide will walk you through what variables are, how to create them, and why they’re so powerful in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Variables in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a variable as a named box where you store something—like a number, a piece of text, or a list. The name you give the variable helps you find and use that data later. In Python, variables are **symbolic names** that point to objects stored in your computer’s memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what makes Python variables special:\n",
    "- **Assignment**: You create a variable by assigning it a value using the `=` operator (e.g., `name = \"Alice\"`).\n",
    "- **Dynamic Typing**: Python figures out the type of data (like number or text) automatically, and you can change the type by assigning a new value.\n",
    "- **Naming Rules**: Variable names can include letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`), but they can’t start with a number. Use **snake_case** (e.g., `my_variable`) for readable multi-word names.\n",
    "- **Scope**: Variables exist in different contexts (e.g., inside a function or globally), which affects where you can use them.\n",
    "- **No Limits**: You can create as many variables as your computer’s memory allows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating variables\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"  # A string object\n",
    "age = 25       # An integer object\n",
    "is_student = True  # A boolean object\n",
    "\n",
    "print(name, age, is_student)  # Output: Alice 25 True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters**: Because everything in Python is an object, variables are just references to these objects. This makes Python flexible but also means you need to understand how variables interact with objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main way to create a variable in Python is by using the **assignment operator** (`=`). The syntax is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **variable_name**: The name you choose for your variable (e.g., `score`, `user_name`).\n",
    "- **value**: Any Python object, such as a number (`42`), string (`\"hello\"`), list (`[1, 2, 3]`), or even a custom object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assigning different types of values\n",
    "count = 10              # Integer\n",
    "price = 19.99           # Float\n",
    "greeting = \"Hello!\"     # String\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3]     # List\n",
    "\n",
    "print(count, price, greeting, numbers)\n",
    "# Output: 10 19.99 Hello! [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also reassign a variable to a different type:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5        # x is an integer\n",
    "x = \"Python\" # Now x is a string\n",
    "print(x)     # Output: Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point**: When you assign a value, Python creates an object (if it doesn’t already exist) and makes the variable point to it. If you reassign the variable, it points to a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How “Everything is an Object” Works\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, every piece of data is an object with:\n",
    "- A **type** (e.g., `int`, `str`, `list`): Defines what kind of data it is.\n",
    "- An **identity** (a unique ID): You can check this with the `id()` function.\n",
    "- **Attributes and methods**: Objects have properties and actions (e.g., a string has a `.upper()` method).\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables don’t store the data directly—they’re like pointers to objects in memory. This is why understanding objects is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Variables and Objects\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 42\n",
    "b = 42\n",
    "print(id(a), id(b))  # Same ID because Python reuses the same object for 42\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 100\n",
    "print(id(a))  # Different ID because a now points to a new object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What’s Happening?** Python is efficient—it reuses small integers and some strings to save memory. When you assign `a = 42` and `b = 42`, both variables point to the same object. Changing `a` to `100` makes it point to a new object, leaving `b` unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try This\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"hello\"\n",
    "print(type(text))    # Output: <class 'str'>\n",
    "print(text.upper())  # Output: HELLO\n",
    "print(id(text))      # Unique ID for the string object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway**: Since everything is an object, you can use variables to work with any kind of data, and Python’s flexibility lets you explore endless possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices for Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To write clear and reliable code:\n",
    "- **Use Meaningful Names**: Choose names like `total_score` instead of `ts` to make your code readable.\n",
    "- **Follow Snake Case**: Write multi-word variables as `user_age`, not `userAge`.\n",
    "- **Avoid Reserved Words**: Don’t use Python keywords like `if`, `for`, or `class` as variable names.\n",
    "- **Understand Scope**: Variables inside functions (local) are separate from those outside (global). For example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  x = 10  # Global\n",
    "  def my_function():\n",
    "      x = 5  # Local\n",
    "      print(x)  # Output: 5\n",
    "  my_function()\n",
    "  print(x)  # Output: 10\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Beginner Tip**: If you’re unsure about a variable’s type or value, use PyCharm’s **Python Console** (Tools > Python Console) to experiment. Type `type(my_variable)` or `print(my_variable)` to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters for Your Coding Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding variables and the “everything is an object” concept is like learning the alphabet of Python. It’s the foundation for building programs, from simple scripts to complex apps. By mastering variables, you’ll:\n",
    "- Write code that’s easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "- Avoid common mistakes, like confusing variable scopes.\n",
    "- Feel confident manipulating data in creative ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation Tip**: If this feels tricky, that’s okay! Every coder struggles at first. Try small experiments, like creating variables for your favorite things (e.g., `pet = \"cat\"`), and play with them in PyCharm. You’re building skills that will open doors to exciting projects!\n",

    "\n",
    " **Objective**: Organize data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Primitive Types – The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "These are Python’s simplest, **immutable** (unchangeable) data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integer (`int`)**: Whole numbers (e.g., `42`, `-7`)\n",
    "- **Float (`float`)**: Decimals (e.g., `3.14`, `0.001`)\n",
    "- **Boolean (`bool`)**: `True` or `False`\n",
    "- **String (`str`)**: Text (e.g., `\"Hello\"`, `\"Python\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 25  # int\n",
    "price = 9.99  # float\n",
    "is_student = True  # bool\n",
    "name = \"Alex\"  # str\n",
    "print(age, type(age))  # 25 <class 'int'>\n",
    "print(name, type(name))  # Alex <class 'str'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several **built-in data types** that you can use out of the box because they’re built into the language. From all the built-in types available, you’ll find that a few of them represent basic objects, such as numbers, strings and characters, bytes, and Boolean values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the term **basic** (primitive) refers to objects that can represent data you typically find in real life, such as numbers and text. It doesn’t include **composite data types** (non-primitive), such as **lists**, **tuples**, **dictionaries**, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive data types in Python are the most basic types of data. They are the building blocks for data manipulation in Python are typically immutable, meaning their value cannot change after they are created. Here are the main primitive data types in Python:\n",

    "\n",
    "These are Python’s built-in **mutable** or **immutable** collections for organizing multiple items:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-primitive data types, also known as complex or composite data types, are data types that are derived from primitive data types. They can store multiple values or more complex structures of data. Unlike primitive types, non-primitive data types are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Non-Primitive Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **List (`list`)**: Ordered, mutable. Like a shopping list.\n",
    "  - Example: `fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]`\n",
    "  - Try: `fruits.append(\"orange\")`\n",
    "  - Output: `[\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuple (`tuple`)**: Ordered, immutable. Like a fixed record.\n",
    "  - Example: `point = (3, 4)`\n",
    "  - Use for data that shouldn’t change.\n",

    "- **Dictionary (`dict`)**: Key-value pairs. Like a phonebook.\n",
    "  - Example: `person = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 20}`\n",
    "  - Try: `print(person[\"name\"])` → `\"Alice\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Set (`set`)**: Unordered, unique items. Like a collection of rare coins.\n",
    "  - Example: `numbers = {1, 2, 3}`\n",

    "**Choosing the Right One**:\n",
    "- **List**: Frequent changes.\n",
    "- **Tuple**: Fixed data.\n",
    "- **Dictionary**: Fast key-based lookups.\n",

    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, dictionaries (or dicts for short) are a central data structure. Dicts store an arbitrary number of objects, each identified by a unique dictionary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because dictionaries are so important, Python features a robust dictionary implementation that’s built directly into the **core language**: the dict **data type**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are also often called maps, hashmaps, lookup tables, or associative arrays. They allow for the efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of any object associated with a given key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phone books make a decent real-world analog for dictionary objects. They allow you to quickly retrieve the information (phone number) associated with a given key (a person’s name). Instead of having to read a phone book front to back to find someone’s number, you can jump more or less directly to a name and look up the associated information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analogy breaks down somewhat when it comes to how the information is organized to allow for fast lookups. But the fundamental performance characteristics hold. Dictionaries allow you to quickly find the information associated with a given key.\n",

    "## 1. String Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings (`str`) represent text in Python. String methods are used for tasks like formatting, searching, and splitting text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common String Methods\n",
    "- `str.capitalize()`: Capitalizes the first character.\n",
    "- `str.lower()`: Converts all characters to lowercase.\n",
    "- `str.upper()`: Converts all characters to uppercase.\n",
    "- `str.strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace.\n",
    "- `str.replace(old, new)`: Replaces all occurrences of `old` with `new`.\n",
    "- `str.split(sep)`: Splits the string into a list at `sep` (default: whitespace).\n",
    "- `str.join(iterable)`: Joins elements of `iterable` into a string using the string as a separator.\n",
    "- `str.find(sub)`: Returns the lowest index of substring `sub` (-1 if not found).\n",
    "- `str.count(sub)`: Counts occurrences of `sub`.\n",
    "- `str.startswith(prefix)`: Checks if the string starts with `prefix`.\n",
    "- `str.endswith(suffix)`: Checks if the string ends with `suffix`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1: Basic string manipulation\n",
    "text = \"  hello WORLD  \"\n",
    "print(text.capitalize())  # Output: \"Hello world\"\n",
    "print(text.lower())       # Output: \"hello world\"\n",
    "print(text.upper())       # Output: \"HELLO WORLD\"\n",
    "print(text.strip())       # Output: \"hello WORLD\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2: Replacing and splitting\n",
    "sentence = \"I like to learn Python\"\n",
    "print(sentence.replace(\"Python\", \"coding\"))  # Output: \"I like to learn coding\"\n",
    "print(sentence.split())                     # Output: ['I', 'like', 'to', 'learn', 'Python']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 3: Joining and searching\n",
    "words = ['hello', 'world']\n",
    "print(\"-\".join(words))         # Output: \"hello-world\"\n",
    "print(sentence.find(\"Python\"))  # Output: 14\n",
    "print(sentence.count(\"o\"))     # Output: 2\n",
    "print(sentence.startswith(\"I\")) # Output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "1. Create a string `name = \"john doe\"`. Use a method to capitalize it properly (e.g., \"John Doe\").\n",
    "2. Take the string `text = \"banana, apple, banana\"`. Replace all instances of \"banana\" with \"orange\".\n",
    "3. Split the string `data = \"a,b,c,d\"` into a list using \",\" as the separator.\n",
    "4. Join the list `[\"cat\", \"dog\", \"bird\"]` into a string with a space separator.\n",
    "5. Check if the string `filename = \"document.txt\"` ends with \".txt\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solutions\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. name.capitalize() or name.title()\n",

    "## Final Notes\n",
    "- **Practice Regularly**: Use Python’s interactive shell or an IDE to experiment with these methods.\n",
    "- **Explore Further**: Check the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) for additional methods (e.g., for tuples or files).\n",
    "- **Build Projects**: Apply these methods in small scripts, like a to-do list or text analyzer, to solidify your skills.\n",
    "- **Debugging Tip**: If a method raises an error (e.g., `KeyError` in `set.remove()`), read the error message and check your inputs.\n",

    "### Functions and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    " Functional Programming – Writing Elegant Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming uses **pure functions** (no side effects) to make code modular and predictable. In Python, a function is a named sequence of statements that belong together. Their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for a **function definition** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Defining Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Create reusable code with `def`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "print(greet(\"Bob\"))  # Hello, Bob!\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can make up any names we want for the functions we create (greet), except that we can’t use a name that is a Python keyword, and the names must follow the rules for legal identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be indented from the def. In the examples in this book, we will use the standard indentation of four spaces. Function definitions are the second of several compound statements we will see, all of which have the same pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A header line which begins with a keyword and ends with a colon.\n",
    "- A body consisting of one or more Python statements, each indented the same amount — the Python style guide recommends 4 spaces — from the header line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Python return Statement: Usage and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, these kinds of named code blocks are known as functions because they always send a value back to the caller. The Python documentation defines a function as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can return any Python object to the caller code.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://realpython.com/python-return-statement/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Functional Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- **map()**: Apply a function to every item in an iterable.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))\n",
    "  print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **filter()**: Select items based on a condition.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "  evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
    "  print(evens)  # [2, 4]\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "## Overview of the `sort()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sort()` method is used to sort the elements of a list in place, meaning it modifies the original list rather than creating a new one. It is highly flexible, allowing you to sort in ascending or descending order and even customize the sorting logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list.sort(key=None, reverse=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `key`: (Optional) A function to customize sorting (e.g., sorting by length or a specific attribute).\n",
    "  - `reverse`: (Optional) A boolean; set to `True` for descending order, `False` for ascending (default).\n",
    "- **Return Value**: None (modifies the list in place).\n",
    "- **Applicability**: Works on lists containing comparable elements (e.g., numbers, strings, or objects with a defined comparison).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **In-Place Sorting**: Changes the original list, saving memory compared to `sorted()`.\n",
    "- **Comparable Elements**: Elements must be comparable (e.g., you can’t sort a mix of strings and integers without a `key` function).\n",
    "- **Custom Sorting**: The `key` parameter allows sorting based on a function’s output.\n",
    "- **Stable Sorting**: Maintains the relative order of equal elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Basic Sorting\n",
    "Sort a list of numbers or strings in ascending order.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [4, 2, 8, 1]\n",
    "numbers.sort()\n",
    "print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 8]\n",

    "words.sort()\n",
    "print(words)  # Output: [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Descending Order\n",
    "Use `reverse=True` to sort in descending order.\n",

    "numbers = [4, 2, 8, 1]\n",
    "numbers.sort(reverse=True)\n",
    "print(numbers)  # Output: [8, 4, 2, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Custom Sorting with `key`\n",
    "Sort a list of strings by their length using a `key` function.\n",

    "  mixed.sort(key=str)  # Works by converting all to strings\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Modifying the Original**: Since `sort()` modifies the list in place, make a copy if you need to preserve the original.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  original = [3, 1, 2]\n",
    "  copy = original.copy()\n",
    "  copy.sort()\n",

    "- **Experiment with `key`**: Use lambda functions or built-in functions (e.g., `len`, `str.lower`) to create custom sorting logic.\n",
    "- **Compare with `sorted()`**: Use `sorted()` when you need a new list, and `sort()` when you want to modify the original.\n",
    "- **Test Edge Cases**: Try sorting empty lists, single-element lists, or lists with duplicate elements.\n",

    "# Functional Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming emphasizes pure functions, immutability, and treating functions as first-class citizens. In this paradigm, functions transform data arrays to produce new arrays with enhanced features. Three core operations define functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There are three fundamental operations in functional programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mapping**: Transforms each element of an iterable using a function, yielding a new iterable of modified elements.\n",
    "- **Filtering**: Selects elements from an iterable based on a predicate (Boolean-valued) function, producing a new iterable of elements that meet the condition.\n",
    "- **Reducing**: Combines elements of an iterable using a reduction function to compute a single cumulative result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Python is primarily an imperative language, it supports functional programming through several features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anonymous Functions**: Lambda expressions enable concise, inline function definitions.\n",
    "- **`map()` Function**: Applies a transformation function to each element of an iterable.\n",
    "- **`filter()` Function**: Selects elements from an iterable based on a predicate function.\n",
    "- **`reduce()` Function**: Aggregates iterable elements into a single value (available in the `functools` module).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, or assigned to variables. Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions are called **higher-order functions**, a key concept in functional programming that enables powerful abstractions and composability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mapping: Square each number\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))  # [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filtering: Keep even numbers\n",
    "evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))  # [2, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reducing: Sum all numbers\n",
    "total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)  # 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these features, Python developers can adopt a functional style to write concise, declarative, and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Understanding Truth Values in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, objects are evaluated as `True` or `False` in Boolean contexts, such as `if` statements, `while` loops, or logical operations. Understanding which objects are **truthy** or **falsy** is essential for writing robust code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Falsy Objects\n",
    "The following objects evaluate to `False` in a Boolean context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constants**: `None` and `False`\n",
    "- **Zero-valued numeric types**: `0` (integer), `0.0` (float), `0j` (complex), `decimal.Decimal(0)`, `fractions.Fraction(0, 1)`\n",
    "- **Empty sequences and collections**: `\"\"` (empty string), `()` (empty tuple), `[]` (empty list), `{}` (empty dictionary), `set()` (empty set), `range(0)` (empty range)\n",
    "- **Custom objects**: Objects where `__bool__()` returns `False` or `__len__()` returns `0`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Truthy Objects\n",
    "Any object not listed above is considered **truthy** and evaluates to `True` in a Boolean context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Falsy examples\n",
    "if not None:  # Evaluates to False\n",
    "    print(\"None is falsy\")\n",
    "if not 0:  # Evaluates to False\n",
    "    print(\"0 is falsy\")\n",
    "if not []:  # Evaluates to False\n",
    "    print(\"Empty list is falsy\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Truthy examples\n",
    "if \"hello\":  # Evaluates to True\n",
    "    print(\"Non-empty string is truthy\")\n",
    "if 42:  # Evaluates to True\n",
    "    print(\"Non-zero number is truthy\")\n",
    "if [1, 2, 3]:  # Evaluates to True\n",
    "    print(\"Non-empty list is truthy\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Notes\n",
    "- The `__bool__()` method, if defined, determines an object's truth value. If absent, Python falls back to `__len__()` for collections or assumes `True` for non-zero, non-empty objects.\n",
    "- Understanding truth values is critical for conditional logic and avoiding unexpected behavior in Python programs.\n",

    "Understanding Python Modules and Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide introduces Python modules, how to import them, and the `__name__ == \"__main__\"` pattern. It’s designed for beginners to grasp these core concepts with clear explanations and practical examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **module** is a Python file (`.py`) containing code like functions, classes, or variables that you can reuse in other programs. Think of it as a toolbox: you can \"borrow\" tools (code) from one toolbox (file) to use in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a file `hello.py` with a function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# hello.py\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    return \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can import and use it in another file or environment (like Jupyter Notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "To use code from another file, you **import** it as a module. Python lets you import:\n",
    "- Built-in modules (e.g., `math`, `random`).\n",
    "- Your own `.py` files.\n",
    "- Files from other folders (with some setup).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Import\n",
    "If `hello.py` is in the same directory as your script, you can import it:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import hello\n",
    "\n",
    "print(hello.greet())  # Output: Hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also **alias** the module for convenience:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import hello as h\n",
    "\n",
    "print(h.greet())  # Output: Hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing from Different Directories\n",
    "If your file is in another folder, you’ll need to adjust the import. Here are resources to help:\n",
    "- [Importing files from a different folder](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4383571/importing-files-from-different-folder)\n",
    "- [Importing a `.py` file in another directory in Jupyter Notebook](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49264194/import-py-file-in-another-directory-in-jupyter-notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if `hello.py` is in a subfolder called `utils`, you might write:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from utils import hello\n",
    "\n",
    "print(hello.greet())\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Tip**: If you’re using Jupyter Notebook, ensure the file’s path is accessible, or add the folder to Python’s path using `sys.path.append()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s Available After Importing?\n",
    "Once imported, all **functions**, **classes**, and **variables** defined in the module are accessible. For instance, if `hello.py` contains:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# hello.py\n",
    "class Greeter:\n",
    "    def say_hi(self):\n",
    "        return \"Hi!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "message = \"Welcome\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can access them like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import hello\n",
    "\n",
    "greeter = hello.Greeter()\n",
    "print(greeter.say_hi())  # Output: Hi!\n",
    "print(hello.message)     # Output: Welcome\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices for Writing Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating modules, follow these guidelines to keep your code organized and reusable:\n",
    "1. **Wrap code in functions or classes**: Avoid loose code (e.g., `print(\"Hello\")`) at the top level of a module, as it runs immediately when imported.\n",
    "2. **Use short scripts for standalone tasks**: If you write a script, keep it concise and include the `__name__` guard (explained below).\n",
    "3. **Test your module**: Ensure functions and classes work as expected before importing them elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad practice\n",
    "print(\"This runs when imported!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Do this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good practice\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    print(\"This only runs when I want it to!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `__name__ == \"__main__\"` Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll often see this in Python files:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"This code runs only if I run the file directly!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Does It Mean?\n",
    "- Every Python module has a special variable called `__name__`.\n",
    "- When you run a file directly (e.g., `python3 myfile.py`), `__name__` is set to `\"__main__\"`.\n",
    "- When the file is **imported** as a module, `__name__` is set to the module’s name (e.g., `hello` for `hello.py`).\n",
    "- The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures code inside it only runs when the file is executed directly, not when it’s imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Is It Useful?\n",
    "This pattern lets you:\n",
    "- **Write reusable modules**: Code in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block won’t run when the module is imported, preventing unwanted side effects.\n",
    "- **Test your module**: You can include test code that runs only when you execute the file directly.\n",
    "- **Keep code organized**: It separates \"script\" logic (what runs directly) from \"module\" logic (what’s reusable).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Here’s a complete example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# my_module.py\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    # This only runs when you run `python3 my_module.py`\n",
    "    print(\"Testing the add function:\")\n",
    "    print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you import this module elsewhere:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import my_module\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_module.add(4, 5))  # Output: 9\n",
    "# The print statements in my_module.py won’t run!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try It Yourself\n",
    "1. Create a file `math_utils.py`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(num):\n",
    "    return num * num\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"Testing square:\", square(4))  # Output: 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Run it directly (`python3 math_utils.py`). You’ll see the test output.\n",
    "3. Import it in another file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math_utils\n",
    "\n",
    "print(math_utils.square(5))  # Output: 25\n",
    "# No test output appears!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "- **Modules** are Python files you can import to reuse code.\n",
    "- Import your `.py` files with `import`, and use aliases for convenience.\n",
    "- Organize modules by wrapping code in **functions** or **classes**, avoiding loose top-level code.\n",
    "- Use `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` to control what runs when a file is executed directly vs. imported.\n",
    "- Practice importing and writing modules to build clean, modular Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering modules and the `__name__` pattern, you’ll write code that’s easier to reuse, test, and share with others. Keep experimenting with small projects to solidify these concepts!\n",

    "\n",
    "### Deeper Differences\n",
    "1. **Accessibility**:\n",
    "   - Built-ins: Global namespace or `__builtins__` (e.g., `dir(__builtins__)`).\n",
    "   - Standard Library: In `Lib/` directory, needs import (e.g., `math.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Purpose**:\n",
    "   - Built-ins: Fundamental operations (e.g., `len()` for length).\n",
    "   - Standard Library: Specialized tools (e.g., `math` for advanced math).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Learning Curve**:\n",
    "   - Built-ins: ~70 functions, 20+ types, easy for beginners.\n",
    "   - Standard Library: Hundreds of modules, requires exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extensibility**:\n",
    "   - Built-ins: Fixed, can’t add new ones.\n",
    "   - Standard Library: Modular, updated with Python releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters for Learners\n",
    "- **Efficient Code**: Use built-ins for simple tasks, standard library for complex ones.\n",
    "- **Avoid Redundancy**: Standard library solves common problems (e.g., `csv`).\n",
    "- **Manage Dependencies**: Standard library reduces external package needs.\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Know whether errors involve built-ins or modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Tips\n",
    "1. **Master Built-ins**:\n",
    "   - Use `dir(__builtins__)` to explore.\n",
    "   - Practice `print()`, `len()`, `list`, etc.\n",
    "   - Write programs using only built-ins.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explore Standard Library**:\n",
    "   - Start with `math`, `random`, `os`, `datetime`.\n",
    "   - Read [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).\n",
    "   - Use `dir(module)` (e.g., `import math; dir(math)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combine in Projects**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import os\n",
    "   import math\n",
    "\n",
    "   numbers = [1, 4, 9]  # Built-in list\n",
    "   print(f\"Numbers: {numbers}\")  # Built-in str\n",
    "\n",
    "   square_roots = [math.sqrt(n) for n in numbers]  # Standard library\n",
    "   print(f\"Square roots: {square_roots}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(f\"Directory: {os.getcwd()}\")  # Standard library\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Experiment**:\n",
    "   - Use REPL to test (e.g., `random.choice(['apple', 'banana'])`).\n",
    "   - Compare built-ins vs. modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check Python Version**:\n",
    "   - Built-ins evolve slowly (e.g., `match` in 3.10).\n",
    "   - Standard library adds features (e.g., `zoneinfo` in 3.9).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "- **Assuming Built-in**: `sqrt()` needs `import math`.\n",
    "- **Overlooking Modules**: Don’t rewrite `json` or `csv` logic.\n",
    "- **Unnecessary Imports**: Use `+` instead of `math` for simple math.\n",
    "- **Name Confusion**: `str` is a type, not a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Notes\n",
    "- **Namespace**: Avoid overriding built-ins (e.g., `list = [1, 2]`).\n",
    "- **Source Code**: See `Lib/` or GitHub for standard library.\n",
    "- **Custom Modules**: Standard library models good module design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Built-ins are for basic tasks, while the standard library handles specialized jobs. Master built-ins first, explore the standard library gradually, and combine them in projects. Check the docs and experiment to grow your skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask for specific examples or projects to dive deeper!\n",

    "# Understanding List Comprehensions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions in Python provide a concise and readable way to create lists by applying an operation to each element of an iterable. Every list comprehension consists of three core components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expression**: This defines the operation or transformation applied to each element, producing the values that will populate the new list. It can be the element itself, a method call, a mathematical operation, or any valid Python expression that returns a value. For example, in the list comprehension `[number * number for number in range(10)]`, the expression `number * number` computes the square of each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Member**: The variable representing each element in the iterable as it is processed. This variable is used within the expression to generate the output values. In the example above, `number` is the member, acting as a placeholder for each value from the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterable**: The source of the elements, which can be any iterable object such as a list, tuple, set, string, range, or generator that yields elements one at a time. In the example, `range(10)` is the iterable, producing numbers from 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = [number * number for number in range(10)]\n",
    "print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use List Comprehensions?\n",
    "- **Concise**: They replace verbose loops with a single line of code.\n",
    "- **Readable**: When written clearly, they express intent more directly than equivalent `for` loops.\n",
    "- **Efficient**: They are generally faster than appending to a list in a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes\n",
    "- List comprehensions can include conditionals (e.g., `[x * x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]` for even squares).\n",
    "- They can be nested for more complex transformations, though readability should be prioritized.\n",
    "- Alternatives like `map()` or generator expressions (`(x * x for x in range(10))`) may be used for specific cases, but list comprehensions strike a balance of clarity and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more complex examples or specific use cases, explore the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions).\n"
